# The garage

The garage is where I'm storing all my tools.
Currently, there are 3 tools on my garage

* A core java module written in vanilla java 17
* A REST API written with SpringBoot 2
* A frontend developped in Angular


Prerequisite  : Docker should be installed on your computer

To launch the garage, just execute the following command into a terminal : 
```
docker compose up
```

The garage is now available on : http://localhost:4200
